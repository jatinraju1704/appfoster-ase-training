Variables : Init & Dec.
    let myvar;
    myvar = "Hello";
    let myvar = "Hello";

Data Types : 
    String
    Numbers
    Boolean
    Array - let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];
    Object - let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');

    Difference between == and === :

    The main difference between the two operators is how they compare values. 
    The == operator compares the values of two variables after performing type conversion if necessary. 
    On the other hand, the === operator compares the values of two variables without performing type conversion.

    const num = 10;
    const str = "10";

    console.log(num == str); // true - The values are the same after type conversion
    console.log(num === str); // false - The values are different types and not equal

    const name = 'Alice';
    const age = 25;

    // Using template literals
    const message = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
    console.log(message); // Output: My name is Alice and I am 25 years old.

Operators : 
    [ +, -, *, /, = ]
    === : This performs a test to see if two values are equal and of the same data type. 
            It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.
    !, !== : This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. 
            It turns a true into a false, etc..

Functions : 
    function name(args1,args2, ...) {
        // body of function
    }

Events : 
    These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. 
    The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. 
    To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage:

    document.querySelector("html").addEventListener("click", function () {
    alert("Ouch! Stop poking me!");
    });


Difference between QuerySelector and getElementById :
    They both retrieve elements from a webpage, however the both have specific uses. 
    If you want your code to be the most efficient and effective code, then when you are trying to retrieve an id then you should use getElementById. 
    If you are trying to retrieve a class or tag then you should use querySelector.
