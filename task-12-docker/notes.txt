Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 


Basic docker operations:

    docker build -t <image-name> . (building image of the app)

    docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 <image-name>  (running the container that holding holds your image)

    docker ps (showing running containers)

    docker stop <container-id> (stopping the container)

    docker rm <container-id> (removing conainter)


Share the Docker image
    create repo on docker hub. mark it as public

    docker push jatinraju/reponame - it fails (you need to give the tag to the image first)
    
    docker image ls (showing list of images)

    docker login -u jatinraju

    docker tag <image-name> jatinraju/reponame (giving tag to the image) 

    docker push jatinraju/reponame (pushing the image tag into docker hub)

Run Image on new instance
    open 'https://labs.play-with-docker.com/'

    Select the ADD NEW INSTANCE option on the left side bar. 

    docker run -dp 0.0.0.0:3000:3000 docker-id/reponame  (pull image from the docker hub and runs on port 3000 with new instance)
